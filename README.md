Joe and Anish did a great job working with our JavaScript files to make sure our APIs were working and functioning properly with the rest of our code. Dan and George also worked with our JavaScript to make sure the Ticketmaster and Last.FM APIs were accepted in our file and ready to move forward. Kaitlyn did our CSS styling and prepared our presentation.
